## 2.0.0 - 2025-09-22

This release introduces a new component: the outlet. Previously, ClickHouse was
fetching data directly from Kafka. However, this required pushing the protobuf
schema using an out-of-band method. This makes cloud deployments more complex.
The inlet now pushes incoming raw flows to Kafka without decoding them. The
outlet takes them, decodes them, enriches them, and pushes them to ClickHouse.
This also reduces the likelihood of losing packets.

This change should be transparent on most setups but you are encouraged to
review the new proposed configuration in the [quickstart tarball][] and update
your own configuration to move the appropriate configuration from the inlet to
the outlet service.

As it seems a good time as any, Zookeeper is removed from the `docker compose`
setup. ClickHouse Keeper is used instead when setting up a cluster. Kafka is now
using the KRaft mode. You need to recreate the Kafka container:

```console
# docker compose down --remove-orphans
# docker compose rm --volumes kafka
# docker volume rm akvorado_akvorado-kafka
# docker compose pull
# docker compose up -d
```

The documentation has been updated, notably the troubleshooting section.

If you use the monitoring stack, note that the Docker Compose file was split
into `docker-compose-prometheus.yml` for metrics, and `docker-compose-loki.yml`
for logs. You need to update your `.env`. Also, metric scraping is now done by
Grafana Alloy instead of Prometheus andx you need to fix the ownership of the
Prometheus volume:

```console
# docker compose run --user root --entrypoint="/bin/sh -c" prometheus "chown -R nobody:nobody /prometheus"
```

- ✨ *outlet*: new service

- 🩹 *inlet*: fix versioning of metadata cache
- 🩹 *orchestrator*: fix panic in networks CSV refresher

## 1.10.0 - 2024-04-08

In this release, geo IP is now performed in ClickHouse instead of the inlet. When
using the standard `docker compose` setup, the configuration should be
automatically migrated from the inlet component to the orchestrator component.
This also changes how geo IP is used for AS numbers: geo IP is used as a last
resort when configured. It also increases memory usage (1.3GB for ClickHouse).

Another new feature is the ability to use a ClickHouse cluster deployment. This
is enabled when specifying a cluster name in `clickhouse`→`cluster`. There is no
automatic migration of an existing database. You should start from scratch and
copy data from the previous setup. Do not try to enable cluster mode on an
existing setup!

New installations should also get better compression and performance from the
main table, due to a change in the primary key used for this table. Check this
[Altinity article][] if you want to apply the change to your installation.

Support for Docker Compose v1 (`docker-compose` command) has been removed in
favor of Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose` command). On Ubuntu/Debian systems,
this means you can no longer use the `docker-compose` package. On Ubuntu, you
can install the `docker-compose-v2` package. For other options, check the
[documentation for installing the Compose plugin][].

  modify configuration (`AKVORADO_CFG_ORCHESTRATOR_HTTP_LISTEN` instead of
  `AKVORADO_ORCHESTRATOR_HTTP_LISTEN`)
- 💥 *inlet*: `inlet`→`metadata`→`provider(snmp)`→`ports` is now a map from
  exporter subnets to ports, instead of a map from agent subnets to ports. This
  is aligned with how `communities` and `security-parameters` options behave.
- ✨ *inlet*: add [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) geo IP database support and use
  it by default

  directory: you need to move your `akvorado.yaml` to `config/` as well
- 💥 *inlet*: unknown interfaces are not skipped anymore
- ✨ *console*: add subnet aggregation for `SrcAddr` and `DstAddr`
- ✨ *inlet*: expose `Interface.Index` and `Interface.VLAN` to interface classification

When upgrading to this release, it takes some time to reduce the storage size
for a few columns.

- ✨ *console*: add “%” to available units
- 🩹 *inlet*: fix parsing of sFlow IPv4/IPv6 data
- 🩹 *inlet*: fix `Bytes` value for sFlow (this is the L3 length)

- 🌱 *orchestrator*: reduce storage for `InIfDescription`, `OutIfDescription`, `SrcAddr`, `DstAddr`, `Bytes`, and `Packets`

## 1.7.1 - 2023-01-27

This is an important bug fix release. `DstNet*` values were classified using the
source address instead of the destination address.

- 🩹 *orchestrator*: fix `DstNet*` values
- 🌱 *inlet*: if available, use sFlow for `DstASPath`
- 🌱 *docker*: update Kafka UI image

## 1.7.0 - 2023-01-26

This version introduces the ability to customize the data schema used by
*Akvorado*. This change is quite invasive and you should be careful when
deploying it. It requires a ClickHouse restart after upgrading the
orchestrator. It also takes some time to reduce the storage size for `SrcPort`
and `DstPort`.

The orchestrator automatically defines the TTL for the system log tables (like
`system.query_log`). The default TTL is 30 days. You can disable this by setting
`orchestrator`→`clickhouse`→`system-log-ttl` to 0.

- ✨ *inlet*: add `schema`→`enabled`, `schema`→`disabled`,
  `schema`→`main-table-only`, and `schema`→`not-main-table-only` to alter
  collected data
- ✨ *inlet*: add the following collected data (disabled by default):
  - `SrcAddrNAT` and `DstAddrNAT`
  - `SrcPortNAT` and `DstPortNAT`
  - `SrcMAC` and `DstMAC`
  - `SrcVlan` and `DstVlan`
- 🩹 *inlet*: handle correctly interfaces with high indexes for sFlow
- 🩹 *docker*: fix Kafka healthcheck
- 🌱 *inlet*: improve decoding/encoding performance (twice faster!)
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: set TTL for ClickHouse system log tables and `exporters` table
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: reduce storage size for `SrcPort` and `DstPort`
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: add `clickhouse`→`kafka`→`engine-settings` to configure additional Kafka engine settings
- 🌱 *common*: Go profiler endpoints are enabled by default

## 1.6.4 - 2022-12-22

There is a schema update in this version: you also have to restart ClickHouse
after upgrading for it to pick up the new schema.

This version also introduces a cache for some HTTP requests, notably those to
plot the graphs in the “Visualize” tab. The default backend is in-memory,
however the shipped `akvorado.yaml` configuration file is using Redis instead.
The `docker-compose` setup has also been updated to start a Redis container for
this usage. Using Redis is preferred but on upgrade, you need to enable it
explicitly by adding `console`→`http`→`cache` in your configuration.

- ✨ *console*: cache some costly requests to the backend
- ✨ *console*: add `SrcNetPrefix` and `DstNetPrefix` (as a dimension and a filter attribute)
- ✨ *inlet*: add `inlet`→`flow`→`inputs`→`use-src-addr-for-exporter-addr` to override exporter address
- 🌱 *console*: add `limit` and `graph-type` to `console`→`default-visualize-options` 
- 🌱 *docker*: published `docker-compose.yml` file pins the Akvorado image to the associated release
- 🌱 *docker*: update Zookeeper and Kafka images (upgrade is optional)

## 1.6.3 - 2022-11-26

- ✨ *console*: add *100% stacked* graph type
- 🩹 *inlet*: handle non-fatal BMP decoding errors more gracefully

- 🌱 *inlet*: optimize BMP CPU usage, memory usage, and lock times 
- 🌱 *inlet*: replace LRU cache for classifiers by a time-based cache
- 🌱 *inlet*: add TLS support for Kafka transport
- 🌱 *console*: <kbd>Ctrl-Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd-Enter</kbd> when editing a filter now applies the changes
- 🌱 *console*: switch to TypeScript for the frontend code

## 1.6.2 - 2022-11-03

- ✨ *orchestrator*: add `orchestrator`→`network-sources` to fetch network attributes with HTTP
- ✨ *console*: add `console`→`database`→`saved-filters` to populate filters from the configuration file
- 🩹 *documentation*: durations must be written using a suffix (like `5s`)
- 🌱 *docker*: provide a tarball with essential files to install or upgrade a `docker-compose` setup
- 🌱 *inlet*: skip unknown AFI/SAFI in BMP route monitoring messages

## 1.6.1 - 2022-10-11

- 🩹 *inlet*: fix SrcAS when receiving flows with sFlow
- 🩹 *inlet*: do not half-close BMP connection (remote IOS XR closes its own end)
- 🌱 *docker*: split demo exporters out of `docker-compose.yml`
- 🌱 *console*: make the upper limit for dimensions configurable
  (`console`→`dimensions-limit`)

## 1.6.0 - 2022-09-30

This release features a BMP collector to retrieve BGP routes from one or
several routers. The routes can be used to determine source and
destination AS (instead of using GeoIP or information from the flows),
as well as the AS paths and communities. Check `inlet`→`bmp` and
`inlet`→`core` configuration settings for more information.

## 1.5.8 - 2022-09-18

This release bumps the minimum required version for ClickHouse to
22.4. The `docker-compose` file has been updated to use ClickHouse
22.8 (which is a long-term version). Moreover, *Akvorado* now has its
own organization and the code is hosted at
[akvorado/akvorado](https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado).

- 💥 *console*: make ClickHouse interpolate missing values (ClickHouse 22.4+ is required)
- 🩹 *orchestrator*: validate configuration of other services on start
- 🩹 *inlet*: correctly parse `inlet`→`snmp`→`communities` when it is just a string
- 🌱 *cmd*: print a shorter message when an internal error happens when parsing configuration
- 🌱 *inlet*: add `inlet`→`snmp`→`ports` to configure SNMP exporter ports

## 1.5.7 - 2022-08-23

- ✨ *inlet*: add support for flow rate-limiting with `inlet`→`flow`→`rate-limit`
- 🌱 *inlet*: improve performance of GeoIP lookup
- 🌱 *inlet*: add `inlet`→`core`→`asn-providers` to specify how to retrieve AS
  numbers. `inlet`→`core`→`ignore-asn-from-flow` is deprecated and mapped
  to `geoip`.

## 1.5.6 - 2022-08-16

- ✨ *inlet*: add SNMPv3 protocol support
- 🌱 *inlet*: `inlet`→`snmp`→`default-community` is now deprecated

- ✨ *console*: add an option to also display the previous period (day, week, month, year) on stacked graphs
- 🌱 *inlet*: Kafka key is now a 4-byte random value making scaling less dependent on the number of exporters
- 🌱 *demo-exporter*: add a setting to automatically generate a reverse flow
- 🌱 *docker*: loosen required privileges for `conntrack-fixer`

## 1.5.4 - 2022-08-01

`SrcCountry`/`DstCountry` were incorrectly filled in aggregated
tables. This is fixed with this release, but this requires dropping the
existing data (only the country information). See [PR #61][] for more
details.

- ✨ *inlet*: `inlet`→`core`→`default-sampling-rate` also accepts a map from subnet to sampling rate
- ✨ *inlet*: `inlet`→`core`→`override-sampling-rate` enables overriding the sampling rate received from a device
- 🩹 *orchestrator*: fix `SrcCountry`/`DstCountry` columns in aggregated tables [PR #61][]
