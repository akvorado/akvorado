## Unreleased

On this release, geo IP is now performed in ClickHouse instead of inlet. When
using the standard `docker compose` setup, the configuration should be
automatically migrated from the inlet component to the clickhouse component.
This also changes how geo IP is used for AS numbers: geo IP is used as last
resort when configured. It also increases memory usage (1.3GB for ClickHouse).

Another new feature is the ability to use a ClickHouse cluster deployment. This
is enabled when specifying a cluster name in `clickhouse`→`cluster`. There is no
automatic migration of an existing database. You should start from scratch and
copy data from the previous setup. Do not try to enable the cluster mode on
existing setup!

New installations should also get better compression and performance from the
main table, due to a change to the primary key used for this table. Check this
[Altinity article][] if you want to apply the change on your installation.

Support for Docker Compose V1 (`docker-compose` command) has been removed in
favor of Docker Compose V2 (`docker compose` command). On Ubuntu/Debian systems,
this means you can no longer use the `docker-compose` package. On Ubuntu, you
can install the `docker-compose-v2` package. For other options, check the
[documentation for installing the Compose plugin][].

for a few columns.

- ✨ *console*: add “%” to available units
- 🩹 *inlet*: fix parsing of sFlow IPv4/IPv6 data

## 1.7.1 - 2023-01-27

This is an important bugfix release. `DstNet*` values were classified using the
source address instead of the destination address.

- 🩹 *orchestrator*: fix `DstNet*` values
- 🌱 *inlet*: if available, use sFlow for `DstASPath`
- 🌱 *docker*: update Kafka UI image

## 1.7.0 - 2023-01-26

This version introduces the ability to customize the data schema used by
*Akvorado*. This change is quite invasive and you should be cautious when
deploying it. It requires a restart of ClickHouse after upgrading the
orchestrator. It also takes some time to reduce the storage size for `SrcPort`
and `DstPort`.

The orchestrator automatically defines the TTL for the system log tables (like
`system.query_log`). The default TTL is 30 days. You can disable that by setting
`orchestrator`→`clickhouse`→`system-log-ttl` to 0.

- ✨ *inlet*: add `schema`→`enabled`, `schema`→`disabled`,
  `schema`→`main-table-only`, and `schema`→`not-main-table-only` to alter
  collected data
- ✨ *inlet*: add the following collected data (disabled by default):
  - `SrcAddrNAT` and `DstAddrNAT`
  - `SrcPortNAT` and `DstPortNAT`
  - `SrcMAC` and `DstMAC`
  - `SrcVlan` and `DstVlan`
- 🩹 *inlet*: handle correctly interfaces with high indexes for sFlow
- 🩹 *docker*: fix Kafka healthcheck
- 🌱 *inlet*: improve decoding/encoding performance (twice faster!)
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: set TTL for ClickHouse system log tables and `exporters` table
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: reduce storage size for `SrcPort` and `DstPort`
- 🌱 *orchestrator*: add `clickhouse`→`kafka`→`engine-settings` to configure additional settings for the Kafka engine
- 🌱 *common*: Go profiler endpoints are enabled by default

## 1.6.4 - 2022-12-22

There is a schema update in this version: you also have to restart ClickHouse
after upgrading for it to pick the new schema.

This version also introduces a cache for some HTTP requests, notably those to
plot the graphs in the “Visualize” tab. The default backend is in-memory,
however the shipped `akvorado.yaml` configuration file is using Redis instead.
The `docker-compose` setup has also been updated to start a Redis container for
this usage. Use of Redis is preferred but on upgrade, you need to enable it
explicitely by adding `console`→`http`→`cache` in your configuration.

- ✨ *console*: cache some costly requests to the backend
- ✨ *console*: add `SrcNetPrefix` and `DstNetPrefix` (as a dimension and a filter attribute)
- ✨ *inlet*: add `inlet`→`flow`→`inputs`→`use-src-addr-for-exporter-addr` to override exporter address
- 🌱 *console*: add `limit` and `graph-type` to `console`→`default-visualize-options` 
- 🌱 *docker*: published `docker-compose.yml` file pins Akvorado image to the associated release
- 🌱 *docker*: update Zookeeper and Kafka images (this upgrade is optional)

## 1.6.3 - 2022-11-26

- ✨ *console*: add *100% stacked* graph type
- 🩹 *inlet*: handle non-fatal BMP decoding errors more gracefully
- 🩹 *inlet*: fix a small memory leak in BMP collector
- 🩹 *console*: fix selection of the aggregate table to not get empty graphs
- 🩹 *console*: use configured dimensions limit for “Visualize” tab
- 🌱 *inlet*: optimize BMP CPU usage, memory usage, and lock times 
- 🌱 *inlet*: replace LRU cache for classifiers by a time-based cache
- 🌱 *inlet*: add TLS support for Kafka transport
- 🌱 *console*: <kbd>Ctrl-Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd-Enter</kbd> when editing a filter now applies the changes
- 🌱 *console*: switch to TypeScript for the frontend code

## 1.6.2 - 2022-11-03

- ✨ *orchestrator*: add `orchestrator`→`network-sources` to fetch network attributes with HTTP
- ✨ *console*: add `console`→`database`→`saved-filters` to populate filters from the configuration file
- 🩹 *doc*: durations must be written using a suffix (like `5s`)
- 🌱 *docker*: provider a tarball with essential files to install or upgrade a `docker-compose` setup
- 🌱 *inlet*: skip unknown AFI/SAFI in BMP route monitoring messages

## 1.6.1 - 2022-10-11

- 🩹 *inlet*: fix SrcAS when receiving flows with sFlow
- 🩹 *inlet*: do not half-close BMP connection (a remote IOS XR closes its own end)
- 🌱 *docker*: split demo exporters out of `docker-compose.yml`
- 🌱 *console*: make the upper limit for dimensions configurable
  (`console`→`dimensions-limit`)

## 1.6.0 - 2022-09-30

This release features a BMP collector to grab BGP routes from one or
several routers. The routes can be used to determine source and
destination AS (instead of using GeoIP or information from the flows)
but also the AS paths and the communities. Check `inlet`→`bmp` and
`inlet`→`core` configuration settings for more information.

- ✨ *inlet*: BMP collector to get AS numbers, AS paths, and communities from BGP [PR #155][]
- ✨ *inlet*: add `inlet`→`snmp`→`agents` to override exporter IP address for SNMP queries
- 🩹 *inlet*: handle sFlow specific interface number for locally
  originated/terminated traffic, discarded traffic and traffic sent to
  multiple interfaces
- 🌱 *build*: Docker image is built using Nix instead of Alpine

[PR #155]: https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado/pull/155

## 1.5.8 - 2022-09-18

This release bumps the minimal required version for ClickHouse to
22.4. The `docker-compose` file has been updated to use ClickHouse
22.8 (which is a long term version). Moreover, *Akvorado* now has its
own organisation and the code is hosted at
[akvorado/akvorado](https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado).

- 💥 *console*: make ClickHouse interpolate missing values (ClickHouse 22.4+ is required)

- 🌱 *inlet*: Kafka key is now a 4-byte random value making scaling less dependent on the number of exporters
- 🌱 *demo-exporter*: add a setting to automatically generate a reverse flow
- 🌱 *docker-compose*: loosen required privileges for `conntrack-fixer`

## 1.5.4 - 2022-08-01

`SrcCountry`/`DstCountry` were incorrectly filled in aggregated
tables. This is fixed with this release, but this implies dropping the
existing data (only the country information). See [PR #61][] for more
details.

- ✨ *inlet*: `inlet`→`core`→`default-sampling-rate` also accepts a map from subnet to sampling rate
- ✨ *inlet*: `inlet`→`core`→`override-sampling-rate` enables overriding the sampling rate received from a device
- 🩹 *orchestrator*: fix `SrcCountry`/`DstCountry` columns in aggregated tables [PR #61][]

- 🩹 *build*: remove `-dirty` from version number in released Docker images
- 🌱 *console*: hide `::ffff:` prefix from IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses

[PR #57]: https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado/pull/57

## 1.5.1 - 2022-07-22
