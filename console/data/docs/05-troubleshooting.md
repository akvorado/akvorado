# Troubleshooting

## Inlet service

The inlet service outputs some logs and exposes some counters to help
troubleshoot most issues. The first step to check if everything works
as expected is to request a flow:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/flows\?limit=1
{
 "TimeReceived": 1648305235,
 "SequenceNum": 425385846,
 "SamplingRate": 30000,
[...]
```

Be sure to replace `http://akvorado` with the URL to your *Akvorado*
setup. If you are running `docker-compose` locally, this is
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

This returns the next flow. The same information is exported to Kafka.
If this does not work, be sure to check the logs and the metrics. The
later can be queried with `curl`:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/metrics | grep '^akvorado_inlet'
```

### No packets received

When running inside Docker, *Akvorado* may be unable to receive
packets because the kernel redirects these packets to Docker internal
proxy. This can be fixed by flushing the conntrack table:

```console
$ conntrack -D -p udp --orig-port-dst 2055
```

The shipped `docker-compose.yml` file contains an additional service
to do that automatically.

To check that you are receiving packets, check the metrics:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/metrics | grep '^akvorado_inlet_flow_input_udp_packets'
```

Also check that the source IP for your exporters is correct. This is
needed for Akvorado to query them using SNMP. If your exporter cannot
answer SNMP requests on the source IP address, you can specify an
alternative address with `inlet.snmp.agents`.

### No packets exported

*Akvorado* only exports packets with complete information. You can
check the metrics to find the cause:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/metrics | grep '^akvorado_inlet' | grep _errors
```

Here is a list of generic errors you may find:

- `SNMP cache miss` means the information about an interface is not
  found in the SNMP cache. This is expected when Akvorado starts but
  it should not increase. If this is the case, it is likely because
  the exporter is not configured to accept SNMP requests or the
  community configured for SNMP is incorrect.
- `sampling rate missing` means the sampling rate information is not
  present. This is also expected when Akvorado starts but it should
  not increase. With NetFlow, the sampling rate is sent in an options
  data packet. Be sure to configure your exporter to send them (look
  for `sampler-table` in the documentation).
- `input interface missing` means the flow does not contain the input
  interface index. This is something to fix on the exporter.

When using NetFlow, you also have the `template not found` error. This
is expected on start, but then it should not increase anymore.

If *Akvorado* is unable to poll a exporter, no flows about it will be
exported. In this case, the logs contain information such as:

- `exporter:172.19.162.244 poller breaker open`
- `exporter:172.19.162.244 unable to GET`

The `akvorado_inlet_snmp_poller_failure_requests` metric would also
increase for the affected exporter. If your routers are in
`172.16.0.0/12` and you are using Docker, Docker subnets may overlap
with your routers'. To avoid this, you can put that in
`/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restart Docker:

```json
{
 "default-address-pools": [{"base":"240.0.0.0/16","size":24}],
 "userland-proxy": false
}
```

Check that flow are correctly accepted with:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/metrics | grep '^akvorado_inlet_core_flows_forwarded'
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/flows\?limit=1
```

You can check they are correctly forwarded to Kafka with:

```console
$ curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/metrics | grep '^akvorado_inlet_kafka_sent_messages_total'
```

### 4-byte ASN 23456 in flow data

If you are seeing flows with source or destination AS of 23456, your exporter 
needs to be configured with 4-byte ASN support. For example, on Cisco IOS-XE:

```cisco
flow record Akvorado
    collect routing source as 4-octet
    collect routing destination as 4-octet
!
```

### Dropped packets under load

There are various bottlenecks leading to dropped packets. This is bad
as the reported sampling rate is incorrect and we cannot reliably
infer the number of bytes and packets.

#### Bottlenecks on the exporter

The first problem may come from the exporter dropping some of the
flows. Most of the time, there are counters to detect this situation
and it can be solved by lowering the exporter rate.

##### NCS5500 routers

[Netflow, Sampling-Interval and the Mythical Internet Packet Size][1]
contains many information about the limit of this platform. The first
bottleneck is a 133 Mbps shaper between an NPU and the LC CPU for the
sampled packets (144 bytes each). For example, on a NC55-36X100G line
card, there are 6 NPU, each one managing 6 ports. If we consider an
average packet size of 1000, the maximum sampling rate when all ports
are full is 1:700 (formula is `Total-BW / ( Avg-Pkt-Size x 133Mbps ) x
( 144 x 8 )`).

[1]: https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/2018-02-19-netflow-sampling-interval-and-the-mythical-internet-packet-size/

It is possible to check if there are drops with `sh controllers npu
stats voq base 24 instance 0 location 0/0/CPU0` and looking at the
`COS2` line.

The second bottleneck is the size of the flow cache. If too small, it
may overflow. For example:

```console
# show flow monitor monitor1 cache internal location 0/1/CPU0 | i Cache
Cache summary for Flow Monitor :
Cache size:                         100000
Cache Hits:                            202938943
Cache Misses:                         1789836407
Cache Overflows:                         2166590
Cache above hi water:                       1704
```

When this happens, either the `cache timeout rate-limit` should be
increased or the `cache entries` directive should be increased. The
later value can be increased to 1 million par monitor-map.

#### Kernel receive buffers

The second source of drops are the kernel receive buffers. Each
listening queue has a fixed amount of receive buffers (212992 bytes by
default) to keep packets before handling them to the application. When
this buffer is full, packets are dropped.

*Akvorado* reports the number of drops for each listening socket with
the `akvorado_inlet_flow_input_udp_in_drops` counter. This should be
compared to `akvorado_inlet_flow_input_udp_packets`. Another way to get the same
information is by using `ss -lunepm` and look at the drop counter:

```console
$ nsenter -t $(pidof akvorado) -n ss -lunepm
State            Recv-Q           Send-Q                       Local Address:Port                        Peer Address:Port           Process
UNCONN           0                0                                        *:2055                                   *:*               users:(("akvorado",pid=2710961,fd=16)) ino:67643151 sk:89c v6only:0 <->
         skmem:(r0,rb212992,t0,tb212992,f4096,w0,o0,bl0,d486525)
```

In the example above, there were 486525 drops. This can be solved
either by increasing the number of workers for the UDP input or by
increasing the value of `net.core.rmem_max` sysctl and increasing the
`receive-buffer` setting attached to the input.

#### Internal queues

Inside the inlet service, parsed packets are transmitted to one module
to another using channels. When there is a bottleneck at this level,
the `akvorado_inlet_flow_input_udp_out_drops` counter will increase.
There are several ways to fix that:

- increasing the channel between the input module and the flow module,
  with the `queue-size` setting attached to the input,
- increasing the number of workers for the `core` module,
- increasing the number of partitions used by the target Kafka topic,
- increasing the `queue-size` setting for the Kafka module (this can
  only be used to handle spikes).

#### SNMP poller

To process a flow, the inlet service needs the interface name and
description. This information is provided by the `snmp` submodule.
When all workers of the SNMP pollers are busy, new requests are
dropped. In this case, the `akvorado_inlet_snmp_poller_busy_count`
counter is increased. To mitigate this issue, the inlet service tries
to skip exporters with too many errors to avoid blocking SNMP requests
for other exporters. However, ensuring the exporters accept to answer
requests is the first fix. If not enough, you can increase the number
of workers. Workers handle SNMP requests synchronously.

### Reported traffic levels are incorrect

Use `curl -s http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/flows\?limit=1 | grep
SamplingRate` to check if the reported sampling rate is correct. If
not, you can override it with `inlet.core.override-sampling-rate`.

Another cause possible cause is when your router is configured to send
flows for both an interface and its parent. For example, if you have
an LACP-enabled interface, you should collect flows only for the
aggregated interface, not for the individual sub interfaces.

### No traffic visible on the web interface despite receiving flows

The various widgets on the home page are relying on interface
classification to retrieve information. Notably, they expect
f`InIfBoundary` or `OutIfBoundary` to be set to external. You can
check that classification is done correctly with `curl -s
http://akvorado/api/v0/inlet/flows\?limit=1 | grep -E
'If(Boundary|Description|Name)'`. If not, be sure that your rules are
correct and that descriptions match what you expect. For example, on
Juniper, if you enable JFlow on a sub-interface, be sure that the
description is present on this sub-interface.

### Profiling

On a large scale installation, you may want to check if *Akvorado* is using too
much CPU or memory. This can be achieved with `pprof`, the [Go
profiler](https://go.dev/blog/pprof). You need a working [installation of
Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your workstation.

When running on Docker, use `docker inspect` to get the IP address of the inlet:

```console
$ docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' akvorado_akvorado-inlet_1
240.0.4.8
```

If your Docker host is remote, you also need to use SSH forwarding to expose the
HTTP port to your workstation:

```console
$ ssh -L 6060:240.0.4.8:8080 dockerhost.example.com
```

Then, use one of the two following commands:

```console
$ go tool pprof http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/profile
$ go tool pprof http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

The first one provides a CPU profile. The second one a memory profile. On the
command-line, you can type `web` to visualize the result in the browser or `svg`
to get a SVG file you can attach to a bug report if needed.

## Kafka

There is no easy way to look at the content of the flows in a Kafka
topic. However, the metadata can be read using
[kcat](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat/). You can check a topic is
alive with:

```console
$ kcat -b kafka:9092 -C -t flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4 -L
Metadata for flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4 (from broker -1: kafka:9092/bootstrap):
 1 brokers:
  broker 1001 at eb6c7781b875:9092 (controller)
 1 topics:
  topic "flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4" with 4 partitions:
    partition 0, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 1, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 2, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 3, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
$ kcat -b kafka:9092 -C -t flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4 -f 'Topic %t [%p] at offset %o: key %k: %T\n' -o -1
```

Alternatively, when using `docker-compose`, there is a Kafka UI
running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/kafka-ui/`. You can do the following
checks:

- are the brokers alive?
- is the `flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4` topic present and receiving messages?
- is ClickHouse registered as a consumer?

## ClickHouse

First, check that all the tables are present using the following SQL
query through `clickhouse client` (when running with `docker-compose`,
you can use `docker-compose exec clickhouse clickhouse-client`) :

```sql
SHOW tables
```

You should have a few tables, including `flows`, `flows_1m0s` (and
others), and `flows_3_raw`. If one is missing, look at the log in the
orchestrator. This is the component creating the tables.

To check if ClickHouse is late, use the following SQL query through
`clickhouse client` to get the lag in seconds.

```sql
SELECT (now()-max(TimeReceived))/60
FROM flows
```

If the lag is too big, you need to increase the number of consumers. See
[ClickHouse configuration](02-configuration.md#clickhouse) for details. If
ClickHouse ingestion stalls from time to time, it may be because ClickHouse
consumer group is being rebalanced. In
`/var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.err.log`, you may see something
about `Application maximum poll interval exceeded: leaving group`. In this case,
you may want to lower the flush interval:

```yaml
clickhouse:
  kafka:
    engine-settings:
      - kafka_flush_interval_ms = 1000
```

Another way to achieve the same thing is to look at the consumer group
from Kafka's point of view:

```console
$ kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --describe --group clickhouse

GROUP           TOPIC           PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG             CONSUMER-ID                                                                        HOST            CLIENT-ID
clickhouse      flows-ZUYG…     0          5650351527      5650374314      22787           ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-0-77740d0a-79b7-4bef-a501-25a819c3cee4 /240.0.4.8      ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-0
clickhouse      flows-ZUYG…     3          3035602619      3035628290      25671           ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-3-1e4629b0-69a3-48dd-899a-20f4b16be0a2 /240.0.4.8      ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-3
clickhouse      flows-ZUYG…     2          1645914467      1645930257      15790           ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-2-79c9bafe-fd36-42fe-921f-a802d46db684 /240.0.4.8      ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-2
clickhouse      flows-ZUYG…     1          889117276       889129896       12620           ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-1-f0421bbe-ba13-49df-998f-83e49045be00 /240.0.4.8      ClickHouse-ee97b7e7e5e0-default-flows_3_raw-1
```

Errors related to Kafka ingestion are kept in the `flows_3_raw_errors`
table. It should be empty.

If you still have an issue, be sure to check the errors reported by
ClickHouse:

```sql
SELECT last_error_time, last_error_message
FROM system.errors
ORDER BY last_error_time LIMIT 10
FORMAT Vertical
```

Notably, it may complain about a missing schema for a received
message. In this case, you need to ensure the schemas used by
*Akvorado* are available. When using `docker-compose`, you can restart
the orchestrator and ClickHouse to ensure it downloads the latest
schemas. Otherwise, you can manually execute the script installing the
schemas on your ClickHouse server and restart:

```sh
curl http://akvorado/api/v0/orchestrator/clickhouse/init.sh | sh
```
