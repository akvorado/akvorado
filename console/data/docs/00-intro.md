# Introduction

*Akvorado*[^name] receives network flows (currently Netflow/IPFIX and sFlow), enriches
them with interface names (using SNMP), geographic information (using
[IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or MaxMind), and exports them to ClickHouse via
Kafka. It also provides a web interface to browse the results.

[^name]: [Akvorado][] means "water wheel" in Esperanto.

[Akvorado]: https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvorado

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is with
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Docker Compose
V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). On Ubuntu systems, you can
install the `docker-compose-v2` package. On macOS, you can use the
`docker-compose` formula from Homebrew.

```console
# mkdir akvorado
# cd akvorado
# curl -sL https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-quickstart.tar.gz | tar zxvf -
# docker compose up
```

Monitor the output of `docker compose ps`. Once `akvorado-console` service is
present "healthy", *Akvorado* web interface should be running on port 8081. It
can take a few minutes. The demo includes synthetic flow data to help you
explore the features.

### Next steps

To connect your own network devices:

1. **Disable demo data**:
   - Remove the reference to `docker-compose-demo.yml` from `.env`
   - Comment out the last line in `akvorado.yaml`

1. **Customize the configuration** in `akvorado.yaml`:
   - Set SNMP communities for your devices in `outlet` → `metadata` → `provider` → `communities`
   - Configure interface classification rules in `outlet` → `core` → `interface-classifiers`

1. **Configure your routers/switches** to send flows to *Akvorado*:
   - NetFlow/IPFIX: port 2055
   - sFlow: port 6343
   
1. **Restart all containers**
   - `docker compose down --volumes`
   - `docker compose up -d`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Interface classification is essential for the web interface to work properly.
> Without it, you won't see data in the dashboard widgets or visualization tab.
> See the [configuration guide](02-configuration.md) for details.

### Need help?

- Check the [installation guide](01-install.md) for other deployment options
- Read the [configuration guide](02-configuration.md) for detailed setup instructions
- Review the [operations guide](04-operations.md) for router configuration examples
- Check the [troubleshooting guide](05-troubleshooting.md) if you run into an issue

You can get all the expanded configuration (with default values) with
`docker compose exec akvorado-orchestrator akvorado orchestrator
--check --dump /etc/akvorado/akvorado.yaml`.

## Big picture

![General design](design.svg)

*Akvorado* is split into four components:

- The **inlet service** receives flows from exporters and forwards them unparsed
  to Kafka.

- The **outlet service** consumes flows from Kafka, parses them, and enriches
  them with metadata. It polls each exporter using SNMP to get the *system
  name*, the *interface names*, *descriptions* and *speeds*. It applies rules to
  add attributes to exporters. Interface rules attach to each interface a
  *boundary* (external or internal), a *network provider* and a *connectivity
  type* (PNI, IX, transit). Optionally, it may also receive BGP routes through
  the BMP protocol to get the *AS number*, the *AS path*, and the communities.
  The enriched flows are then exported to ClickHouse.

- The **orchestrator service** configures the internal and external components.
  It creates the *Kafka topic* and configures *ClickHouse* to receive the flows
  from the outlet service. It exposes configuration settings for the other
  services to use. It provides to ClickHouse additional data, notably *GeoIP*
  data.

- The **console service** provides a web interface to view and manipulate the
  flows stored in the ClickHouse database.

## ClickHouse database schemas

Flows are stored in a ClickHouse database using a table `flows` (and a
few consolidated versions). The orchestrator service keeps the table
schema up-to-date. You can check the schema using `SHOW CREATE TABLE
flows`.
