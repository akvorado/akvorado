# Introduction

*Akvorado*[^name] receives flows (currently Netflow/IPFIX and sFlow), enriches
them with interface names (using SNMP), geo information (using
[IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or MaxMind), and exports them to Kafka, then
ClickHouse. It also exposes a web interface to browse the result.

[^name]: [Akvorado][] means "water wheel" in Esperanto.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is with
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Docker Compose
V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). On Ubuntu systems, you can
install the `docker-compose-v2` package. On macOS, you can use the
`docker-compose` formula from Homebrew.

```console
# mkdir akvorado
# cd akvorado
# curl -sL https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-quickstart.tar.gz | tar zxvf -
# docker compose up -d
```

Monitor the output of `docker compose ps`. Once `akvorado-console` service is
"healthy", *Akvorado* web interface should be running on port 8081.

A few synthetic flows are generated in the background. To disable them:

1. Remove the reference for `docker-compose-demo.yml` from `.env`,
2. Comment the last line of `akvorado.yaml`, and
3. Run `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`.

If you want to send you own flows, the inlet is accepting both NetFlow
(port 2055) and sFlow (port 6343). You should also customize some
settings in `akvorado.yaml`. They are described in details in the
[“configuration” section](02-configuration.md) section of the
documentation.

- `clickhouse` → `asns` to give names to your internal AS numbers (optional)
- `clickhouse` → `networks` to attach attributes to your networks (optional)
- `inlet` → `metadata` → `provider` → `communities` to set the communities to
  use for SNMP queries (mandatory)
- `inlet` → `core` → `exporter-classifiers` to define rules to attach
  attributes to your exporters (optional)
- `inlet` → `core` → `interface-classifiers` to define rules to attach
  attributes to your interfaces, including the "boundary" attribute
  which is used by default by the web interface (mandatory)

The last point is very important: without classification, the homepage widgets
won't work and nothing will be displayed by default in the “Visualize” tab. The
provided configuration expects your interface to be named `Transit: Cogent`,
`PNI: Akamai`, `PPNI: Fastly`, or `IX: DECIX`.

You can get all the expanded configuration (with default values) with
`docker compose exec akvorado-orchestrator akvorado orchestrator
--check --dump /etc/akvorado/akvorado.yaml`.

Once you are ready, you can run everything in the background with
`docker compose up -d`.

## Big picture

![General design](design.svg)

*Akvorado* is split into three components:

- The **inlet service** receives flows from exporters. It poll each
  exporter using SNMP to get the *system name*, the *interface names*,
  *descriptions* and *speeds*. It applies rules to add attributes to
  exporters. Interface rules attach to each interface a *boundary*
  (external or internal), a *network provider* and a *connectivity
  type* (PNI, IX, transit). Optionally, it may also receive BGP routes
  through the BMP protocol to get the *AS number*, the *AS path*, and
  the communities. The flow is exported to *Kafka*, serialized using
  *Protobuf*.

- The **orchestrator service** configures the internal and external components.
  It creates the *Kafka topic* and configures *ClickHouse* to receive the flows
  from Kafka. It exposes configuration settings for the other services to use.
  It provides to ClickHouse additional data, notably *GeoIP* data.

- The **console service** exposes a web interface to look and
  manipulate the flows stored inside the ClickHouse database.

## Serialized flow schemas

Flows sent to Kafka are encoded with a versioned schema. When the schema
changes, a different Kafka topic is used. For example, the
`flows-ZUYGDTE3EBIXX352XPM3YEEFV4` topic receive serialized flows using a
specific version of the schema. The inlet service exports the schema with its
HTTP service, via the `/api/v0/inlet/flow.proto` endpoint.

## ClickHouse database schemas

Flows are stored in a ClickHouse database using a table `flows` (and a
few consolidated versions). The orchestrator service keeps the table
schema up-to-date. You can check the schema using `SHOW CREATE TABLE
flows`.
