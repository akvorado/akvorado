Hashing was not as fragile as we were only hashing column names, types
and positions, so it is unknown if the new way is strictly better.

The next steps are to use the schema abstraction in other places where
the schema is hard coded: column names for
console (`console/query_consts.go`), protobuf file and flow decoding.
